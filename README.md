# Email Spam Classifaction Model using NLP

This is a guided project to understanding introductory NLP concepts by building a Natural Language Processing (NLP) application to detect spam emails.

NLP concepts used:
* Tokenization
* Lemmatization
* Stop Word Removal
* Bag of Words (BoW)

Key learnings:
* When it comes to comparing classifaction machine learning models of Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and Support Vector Machine, the Random Forest Model performed the highest in accuracy and f-1 score.
* It's important to think about creating a model that takes into account reducing false positives and false negtatives.
    * False positives are legitimate emails that are mistakenly marked as spam by your email filtering system while false negatives are spam emails that are mistakenly allowed to pass through. Both types of errors can cause problems. 
    * False positives can make you miss important messages, damage your reputation, and reduce your deliverability. 
    * False negatives can expose you to scams, fraud, viruses, and other threats, and clutter your inbox with junk.
